This is a client program that connects to a given server. The server defines a communication protocol, which the client has to implement by sending properly formulated messages over a communication pipe. The server hosts several electrocardiogram (ECG) data points of 15 patients suffering from various cardiac diseases. The clientâ€™s goal is to obtain these data points by sending properly-formatted messages that the server understands. In addition, the server can send raw files potentially in several segments.
